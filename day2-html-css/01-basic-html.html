  HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
    1. Double-click this file to open it in your browser
    2. Read what you see on the page
    3. Then come back here and read the code + comments
    4. Try changing things, save, and refresh your browser!

<!--
  THE DOCTYPE DECLARATION
  =======================
  This line tells the browser: "Hey, this is an HTML5 document."
  You don't need to understand it deeply. Just ALWAYS put it
  as the very first line of every HTML file. Think of it as
  saying "I speak English" before starting a conversation.
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
  THE <html> TAG
  ==============
  This is the ROOT of your page. Everything else goes INSIDE this tag.
  Think of it as the outer walls of a house -- everything is contained within.

  lang="en" tells the browser the page is in English.
  This helps screen readers (tools for blind users) read the page correctly.
-->

<head>
  <!--
    THE <head> SECTION
    ==================
    This section is INVISIBLE to the user. They won't see anything here
    on the actual webpage. It contains "behind the scenes" information:
    - The page title (shows in the browser tab)
    - Character encoding (so letters display correctly)
    - Links to CSS files (styling)
    - Other metadata (info about the page)

    Think of <head> as the backstage of a theater -- important, but the
    audience doesn't see it.
  -->

  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!--
    META CHARSET
    ============
    This tells the browser what character set to use.
    UTF-8 supports almost every language and symbol (emojis too!).
    Just always include this line. Don't overthink it.
  -->

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!--
    META VIEWPORT
    =============
    This makes your page look good on phones and tablets.
    Without it, mobile browsers might zoom out and make everything tiny.
    Always include this line.
  -->

  <title>01 - Basic HTML Tags</title>
  <!--
    THE <title> TAG
    ===============
    This is the text that appears in the browser TAB at the top.
    It does NOT appear on the page itself.
    Try changing this text, save the file, and refresh -- look at your browser tab!

    THE <body> SECTION
    ==================
    Everything inside <body> is what the user ACTUALLY SEES on the page.

    <h3>Lesson 1: Headings (h1 through h6)</h3>

    <!--
      HEADINGS: <h1> to <h6>
      ======================
      Headings are like titles and subtitles in a book.

      <h1> is the BIGGEST and most important (like the book title)
      <h2> is the chapter title
      <h3> is a section within a chapter
      ...and so on down to <h6> which is the smallest

      IMPORTANT RULE: Every page should have only ONE <h1>.
      Think of it as the main title of the page.
    -->

    <h1>This is an H1 - The Main Title</h1>
    <!-- h1 = biggest heading. Use ONE per page. Like the title of a book. -->

    <h2>This is an H2 - A Major Section</h2>
    <!-- h2 = second biggest. Like chapter titles in a book. -->

    <h3>This is an H3 - A Subsection</h3>
    <!-- h3 = third biggest. Like sections within a chapter. -->

    <h4>This is an H4 - A Sub-subsection</h4>
    <!-- h4 = getting smaller now. Used less often. -->

    <h5>This is an H5 - Even Smaller</h5>
    <!-- h5 = rarely used in practice -->

    <h6>This is an H6 - The Smallest Heading</h6>
    <!-- h6 = smallest heading. Almost never used. -->

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Interview Tip:</strong> Headings are important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
      and accessibility. Google reads your headings to understand your page content.
      Screen readers use headings to help blind users navigate. Always use headings in order
      (don't skip from h1 to h4).

  <!-- ============================================================== -->

  <div class="example-box">
    <h3>Lesson 2: Paragraphs and Text Formatting</h3>

    <!--
      THE <p> TAG - PARAGRAPHS
      ========================
      The <p> tag creates a paragraph of text.
      The browser automatically adds some space above and below each paragraph.

      Think of it like pressing Enter twice in a Word document.
    -->

    <p>This is a paragraph. It's the most basic way to put text on a page. Each paragraph
    gets its own block of space. Notice how there's a gap between this paragraph and the next one?
    That's automatic.</p>
    <!-- Each <p> tag = one paragraph with automatic spacing -->

    <p>This is a second paragraph. See the space between them? You didn't have to add that --
    the browser does it automatically because each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is a separate block.</p>

    <!--
      TEXT FORMATTING TAGS
      ====================
      These tags change how text LOOKS within a paragraph.
    -->

    <p>
      You can make text <strong>bold using the strong tag</strong>.
      <!-- <strong> = bold text. Also tells screen readers "this is important" -->

      You can make text <em>italic using the em tag</em>.
      <!-- <em> = italic text. "em" stands for "emphasis" -->

      You can even <strong><em>combine bold and italic</em></strong>.
      <!-- You can nest tags inside each other! -->
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag creates a line break.<br>
      See? This text is on a new line, but still in the same paragraph.<br>
      It's like pressing Enter once (not twice).
    </p>
    <!--
      THE <br> TAG - LINE BREAK
      =========================
      Notice something? <br> has NO closing tag. It's a "self-closing" tag.
      Some tags don't need a closing tag because they don't wrap around content.
      <br> just says "go to the next line" -- there's nothing to wrap.
    -->

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Why &lt;strong&gt; instead of &lt;b&gt;?</strong> Both make text bold, but
      <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> also tells screen readers "this text is important."
      Similarly, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is preferred over <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italics.
      In interviews, use the "semantic" (meaningful) tags: strong and em.

    <h3>Lesson 3: Links (Anchor Tags)</h3>

    <!--
      THE <a> TAG - LINKS (ANCHORS)
      ==============================
      The <a> tag creates a clickable link.
      "a" stands for "anchor" (an old term for links).

      The HREF attribute tells the browser WHERE to go when clicked.
      "href" stands for "Hypertext REFerence" -- basically the destination URL.

      FORMAT: <a href="URL">Text the user sees</a>
    -->

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.google.com">Click here to go to Google</a>

      <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Open Google in a new tab</a>

        This is very commonly used so users don't lose their place.

    <p>
      <a href="02-forms.html">Go to the Forms tutorial (file in same folder)</a>

      <strong>Interview Tip:</strong> Always know these <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> attributes:

    -->

    <h3>Lesson 4: Images</h3>

    <!--
      THE <img> TAG - IMAGES
      =======================
      The <img> tag displays an image on the page.

      IMPORTANT: <img> is a SELF-CLOSING tag (like <br>). No closing tag needed.

      KEY ATTRIBUTES:
        src = "source" - the URL or file path of the image
        alt = "alternative text" - description shown if image fails to load
              (also read by screen readers for blind users -- VERY important!)
        width = how wide the image should be (in pixels)
        height = how tall the image should be (in pixels)
    -->

    <p>Here's an image loaded from the internet:</p>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200/4CAF50/ffffff?text=I+am+an+image!"
      alt="A green placeholder image that says 'I am an image'"
      width="400"
      height="200"
    >
    <!--
      src = where the image comes from (a URL in this case)
      alt = what to show/say if the image can't load
      width/height = size in pixels

      NOTE: If you see a broken image icon, that's okay -- it means the
      placeholder service might be down. The ALT text will show instead.
      That's exactly what alt is for!
    -->

    <p>If an image breaks, the alt text shows up:</p>
    <img
      src="this-image-does-not-exist.jpg"
      alt="This image intentionally doesn't exist - see how the alt text shows up?"
      width="400"
      height="100"
    >
    <!--
      This image will show as broken because the file doesn't exist.
      The browser will display the alt text instead.
      This is why alt text is important!
    -->

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Interview Tip:</strong> ALWAYS include the <code>alt</code> attribute on images.
      It's required for accessibility (helping blind users) and it's one of the most
      common things interviewers check. An image without alt text is considered bad practice.

    <h3>Lesson 5: Lists</h3>

    <!--
      There are TWO main types of lists in HTML:

      1. UNORDERED LIST (<ul>) - uses bullet points (dots)
         Think: a grocery list where order doesn't matter

      2. ORDERED LIST (<ol>) - uses numbers (1, 2, 3...)
         Think: step-by-step instructions where order matters

      Both use <li> (list item) for each item in the list.
    -->

    <h4>Unordered List (bullet points):</h4>
    <ul>
      <!--
        <ul> = Unordered List (bullets, no numbers)
        Use when the ORDER doesn't matter.
        Like a shopping list -- it doesn't matter what you buy first.
      -->
      <li>Apples</li>     <!-- <li> = List Item. Each item in the list gets one. -->
      <li>Bananas</li>
      <li>Oranges</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ordered List (numbered):</h4>
    <ol>
      <!--
        <ol> = Ordered List (numbers: 1, 2, 3...)
        Use when the ORDER MATTERS.
        Like recipe steps -- you must do step 1 before step 2.
      -->
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</li>
      <li>Mix the ingredients</li>
      <li>Pour into a pan</li>
      <li>Bake for 30 minutes</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Nested Lists (a list inside a list):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fruits
        <ul>
          <!-- You can put a list INSIDE a list item! This is called "nesting." -->
          <li>Apples</li>
          <li>Bananas</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    <h3>Lesson 6: Divs and Spans (Containers)</h3>

    <!--
      THE <div> TAG - DIVISION / CONTAINER
      =====================================
      A <div> is a generic CONTAINER. It's like a cardboard box.
      By itself, it doesn't do anything visible. But you use it to GROUP
      elements together so you can style them as a unit.

      <div> is a BLOCK element -- it takes up the full width available
      and starts on a new line.

      Think of it like a new paragraph -- it stacks vertically.
    -->

    <div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; padding: 15px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
      <p>I'm inside a blue div!</p>
      <p>Everything in this box is grouped together by the div.</p>
      <!--
        This div has a blue background. See how it wraps around BOTH paragraphs?
        That's the power of div -- it groups things together so you can style
        the whole group at once.
      -->
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #fce4ec; padding: 15px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
      <p>I'm inside a pink div!</p>
      <p>This is a separate group from the blue one above.</p>
    </div>

    <!--
      THE <span> TAG - INLINE CONTAINER
      ===================================
      A <span> is like a <div> but for INLINE content (within a line of text).
      It doesn't start a new line. It wraps around words WITHIN a paragraph.

      Think of it like a highlighter -- you use it to mark specific words
      within a sentence, not to create a new block.
    -->

    <p>
      In this sentence, <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">these words are red and bold</span>
      because they're wrapped in a span with styling. The rest of the text is normal.
    </p>
    <!--
      See how the span only affects "these words are red and bold"?
      It doesn't create a new line or block. It's INLINE -- it flows
      within the text like any other word.
    -->

    <div class="note">
      <strong>DIV vs SPAN - The Simple Rule:</strong>
      <br><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> = BOX (takes full width, starts new line) -- use for grouping sections
      <br><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> = HIGHLIGHTER (inline, doesn't break the line) -- use for styling words within text
      <br><br>
      In Angular, you'll use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> constantly for layout.

    <h3>Bonus: Semantic HTML (Know This for Interviews)</h3>

    <!--
      SEMANTIC HTML
      =============
      "Semantic" means "meaningful." Semantic HTML tags describe their content.
      Instead of using <div> for everything, you can use tags that TELL the browser
      (and other developers) what the content IS.

      This is important for:
      - Accessibility (screen readers understand the page better)
      - SEO (Google understands your content better)
      - Code readability (other developers understand your code faster)
    -->

    <p>Instead of using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for everything, use meaningful tags:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> - The top section of a page (logo, navigation)</li>
      <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> - Navigation links (menus)</li>
      <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code> - The main content of the page</li>
      <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code> - A thematic section of content</li>
      <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code> - Self-contained content (like a blog post)</li>
      <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> - Side content (like a sidebar)</li>
      <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> - The bottom section of a page (copyright, links)</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
      These tags work EXACTLY like <div> visually.
      The difference is they TELL the browser what the content means.

      Think of it this way:
        <div> is like a plain cardboard box with no label.
        <header> is like a box labeled "HEADER STUFF."
        Same box, but now you know what's inside without opening it.
    -->

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Interview Tip:</strong> If an interviewer asks "What is semantic HTML?"
      say: "Semantic HTML uses tags that describe the meaning of content, like
      <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,
      instead of generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags. It improves accessibility, SEO,
